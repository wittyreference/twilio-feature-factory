# Session Learnings

Use this file for the capture-promote-clear workflow. Add discoveries as you work, then promote stable learnings to permanent documentation.

## How to Use

1. **Capture**: Add findings below as you discover them
2. **Promote**: Move stable learnings to permanent docs (DESIGN_DECISIONS.md, CLAUDE.md files, etc.)
3. **Clear**: Remove promoted entries to keep this file focused

## Template

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Session X - Topic

**Discoveries:**

1. **Finding title**: What you learned
   - Details and context
   - Promoted to: [target doc] (add after promoting)
```
