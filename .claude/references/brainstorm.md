# Brainstorming Your Twilio App

This is the starting point for building Twilio applications with AI agents.

## How This Works

```
You describe your idea
    ↓
Claude Code helps you brainstorm (this template)
    ↓
Save output as concept.md for reference
    ↓
Claude Code enters plan mode, creates implementation plan
    ↓
You approve the plan
    ↓
Autonomous agents build it
    (architect → spec → test-gen → dev → review → docs)
```

## Available Twilio Capabilities

- **Voice**: Phone calls, IVR systems, call forwarding, conferencing, recordings
- **Messaging**: SMS, MMS, WhatsApp
- **ConversationRelay**: Real-time voice AI with LLM integration
- **Verify**: Phone number verification, 2FA, passwordless auth
- **Sync**: Real-time state synchronization across devices
- **TaskRouter**: Skills-based routing to workers and agents

## Brainstorming Questions

Let's develop your idea step by step. I'll ask one question at a time:

1. **Problem Statement**: What problem are you trying to solve?

2. **Target Users**: Who will use this prototype?

3. **Key Features**: What are the must-have features?

4. **Twilio Services**: Which Twilio APIs would be most useful?

5. **Integration Points**: What external systems need to connect?

6. **Success Criteria**: How will you know if the prototype works?

## Concept Format

As we discuss, I'll help you develop a concept in this format:

### Concept: [Name]

**Problem**: What it solves

**Solution**: How Twilio helps

**Twilio APIs Used**:
- API 1: Why
- API 2: Why

**Key Features**:
1. Feature one
2. Feature two
3. Feature three

**Technical Considerations**:
- Consideration one
- Consideration two

**Next Steps**:
1. First step
2. Second step

## Start Here

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step concept for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Once we are done, save a copy of the output as `concept.md` so we can refer back to it later. Then I'll enter plan mode to create the implementation plan.

Here's the idea:

```
[Describe what you want to build]
