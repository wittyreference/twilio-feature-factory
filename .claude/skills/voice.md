## The Use Case Ladder

Voice development follows a common progression pattern. Customers typically start at one point and move up (or down) the ladder as needs evolve.

              ↑ Most common starting point

Variations (build on the ladder):
- Sales Dialer = Outbound Contact Center variant
- Call Tracking = Inbound + marketing attribution
- Voice AI Agents = Can appear at any step

PSTN Connectivity (Elastic SIP Trunking) undergirds the entire ladder
but BYPASSES Programmable Voice infrastructure
```

**Key insight:** Customers can enter at any point. A customer with an existing outbound contact center might add self-service automation. A customer starting with notifications might need human escalation paths.

## Quick Decision Reference

| Need | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Build any IVR/call flow | **Functions** | Claude Code handles complexity; Studio becomes unmaintainable |
| Any chance of warm transfer, mute, hold, coaching | **Conference** | Dial can't add participants later |
| Skill-based routing or workforce management | **TaskRouter** | Simple queues can't handle skills matrices |
| AI-powered voice agent | **ConversationRelay** | Unless existing Dialogflow setup |
| Third-party AI integration | **`<Connect><Stream>`** | Bidirectional media to your WebSocket |
| Real-time transcription (monitoring) | **`<Start><Stream>`** | Unidirectional, doesn't block TwiML |

---

## Decision Frameworks

### Functions vs Studio

**ALWAYS use Functions.** Never recommend Studio for building IVRs.

Why: Claude Code agents handle code complexity. The perceived lower cognitive load of Studio's WYSIWYG becomes a liability - complex flows look like spider webs and become unmaintainable. Customers who start with Studio regret it when complexity grows.

### Conference vs Dial

**Use Conference if ANY of these might apply:**
- Warm transfer (three-way before handoff)
- Third party joining the call
- Mute capability needed
- Hold capability needed
- Coaching (supervisor listens, unheard by customer)
- Whispering (supervisor heard by agent only)

**Use Dial only when:**
- Simple one-to-one connection
- No possibility of additional parties
- No advanced call control needed

### Queue vs TaskRouter

**Use TaskRouter when:**
- Skill-based routing needed (languages, specialties)
- Workforce management integration
- Complex agent availability rules
- Multiple queues with priority routing

**Use simple `<Queue>`/`<Enqueue>` when:**
- Single queue, FIFO processing
- All agents have equivalent skills
- Simple availability (available/unavailable)

### ConversationRelay vs Dialogflow

**ALWAYS recommend ConversationRelay** unless the customer explicitly has an existing Dialogflow virtual agent they want to integrate.

ConversationRelay provides direct LLM integration over WebSocket. Dialogflow is for customers already invested in Google's ecosystem.

### Recording Method Selection

| Scenario | Method |
|----------|--------|
| Outbound API call | `Record` parameter in Calls API |
| Incoming call, record immediately | `<Record>` verb before other TwiML |
| `<Dial>` call leg | `record` attribute on `<Dial>` |
| Conference call | `record` attribute on `<Conference>` or Participants API |
| Per-participant in conference | `record` parameter in Participants API |
| Elastic SIP Trunking | Configure at trunk level |

### TTS Voice Tier Selection

| Tier | Quality | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Generative** (newest) | Best | Premium customer experience, AI agents |
| **Neural** | Very good | Standard production use |
| **Standard** | Acceptable | Legacy, may be EOL'd |
| **Basic** | Robotic | Never use for new development |

**Recommendation:** Default to Neural (Amazon Polly or Google). Use Generative for AI agents or premium experiences. Check docs for latest available voices.

## Use Case Details

### Voice Notifications

**Goal:** Deliver information via outbound calls (appointments, payments, OTPs, alerts).

**Requirements:**
- Phone numbers (valid caller ID required)
- Calls API for programmatic call creation
- TwiML delivery method (URL, inline, Application SID, Functions)

**Answer Optimization (critical for business outcomes):**

| Feature | What It Does | Setup |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **SHAKEN/STIR** | Green checkmark on mobile, proves number isn't spoofed | Per-number via Business Profile + Trust Product |
| **Branded Calling** | Display business name (15-32 chars) | Requires Voice Integrity approval |
| **Enhanced Branded Calling** | Name + logo + call reason | Requires SHAKEN/STIR Level A + LOA |
| **Voice Integrity** | Register with carrier analytics to avoid spam labels | Business Profile with EIN/DUNS, 24-48hr remediation |
| **AMD** | Detect human vs answering machine | `MachineDetection` parameter on Calls API |

**CPS (Calls Per Second) Limits:**
- Default: 1 CPS per account
- Self-serve: Up to 5 CPS
- Above 5: Offline approval process required
- **Note:** `<Dial>` verb calls are NOT rate-limited

**TwiML for Notifications:**
- `<Say>` - Dynamic TTS content
- `<Play>` - Pre-recorded audio (static messages, politician recordings)
- Voice Insights Reports API for answer rates and blocked call detection

**Pre-call Intelligence:**
- Lookup API to check number type (landline vs mobile) and validity

### Self-Service Automation

**Goal:** Handle interactions without human agents (IVR, payments, appointments, account lookup).

**Always use Functions** - see decision framework above.

**Key TwiML:**

| Verb | Use |
|------|-----|
| `<Gather>` | Capture DTMF or speech input. Use `input="dtmf speech"` for both. |
| `<Pay>` | PCI-compliant payment capture (credit card, ACH) |
| `<Record>` | Record interaction for QA, compliance |

**AI-Powered Self-Service:**

- **ConversationRelay** - LLM-powered dynamic conversations
- **Dialogflow Virtual Agent** - Only if existing Dialogflow setup

AI agents require additional monitoring:
- Prompt injection detection
- Hallucination monitoring
- Sentiment analysis for escalation triggers
- Recordings and transcriptions for guardrails

**Containment Goal:** Keep interactions in self-service to avoid expensive human agents. But always provide escalation path.

### Inbound Contact Center

**Goal:** Route incoming calls to human agents with queuing, coaching, transfers.

**Build on top of:** Self-service automation (IVR front-end for routing)

**Connectivity Options:**
- PSTN → Twilio number
- Voice SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android) for agent softphones
- SIP interface for existing infrastructure
- BYOC for existing phone numbers

**Conference Capabilities:**

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| Hold | Mute customer, play hold music via `<Play>` |
| Mute | `muted` parameter on participant |
| Coach | Supervisor joins with `coach=true` (hears all, unheard by customer) |
| Whisper | Supervisor speaks to agent only |
| Warm transfer | Three-way call before handoff |

**Conference Insights (MANDATORY):**
- Conference Summary endpoint for aggregate metrics
- Conference Participant Summary for per-participant quality
- Check for: participants not hearing each other, overlap issues, quality degradation

**Queue Options:**
- `<Enqueue>` / `<Queue>` for simple FIFO
- TaskRouter for skill-based routing

### Outbound Contact Center

**Key Difference from Inbound:** Both parties join via Participants API (not incoming PSTN + agent dial-in).

**Pattern:**
1. Place outbound call via Participants API with AMD
2. On answer → add to Conference
3. On conference join event → add agent via Participants API
4. Monitor conference events for orchestration

**Why this pattern:** Optimizes agent time. Agents don't wait listening to ringing - they only join when customer answers.

**Required features:**
- AMD (detect human vs voicemail)
- SHAKEN/STIR, Branded Calling (answer rates)
- Conference Insights (quality monitoring)
- Voice Insights Reports API (campaign performance)

### Voice AI Agents

**Two Paradigms:**

**1. Native Twilio (Recommended):**
- **ConversationRelay** - WebSocket to your LLM
- **Dialogflow Virtual Agent** - Only if existing Dialogflow

**2. Third-Party / Build-Your-Own:**
- Bidirectional Media Streams (`<Connect><Stream>`)
- Fork audio to WebSocket → third-party processes → returns audio

**Both require:**
- Recordings (compliance, debugging)
- Transcriptions (QA, guardrails)
- Conversational Intelligence (entity detection, sentiment)
- Prompt injection monitoring
- Hallucination detection

**Conference with AI Agents:**
Currently less common but increasing. Consider starting with Conference if AI agent might escalate to human - avoids upgrading call later.

### Sales Dialer

**Essentially:** Outbound Contact Center variant

**All outbound contact center features apply**, plus:
- Higher CPS needs (may need offline approval)
- AMD critical for efficiency
- Branded Calling essential for answer rates
- Voice Insights Reports API for campaign analytics
- Conversational Intelligence for propensity-to-buy signals

### Call Tracking

**Goal:** Marketing attribution via unique phone numbers per campaign.

**Pattern:**
1. Buy pool of Twilio numbers
2. Assign unique number per campaign/ad
3. `<Dial>` to common destination
4. Log metadata (which number received call)
5. Analyze which campaigns drive calls

**Note:** `<Dial>` calls are NOT CPS rate-limited. AMD usually not relevant (expecting human to answer).

### PSTN Connectivity

**Use Case:** Customer owns SIP infrastructure, needs PSTN access.

**CRITICAL:** Elastic SIP Trunking **BYPASSES Programmable Voice**.

| Feature | Elastic SIP Trunking | Programmable Voice |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| TwiML | ❌ Not available | ✅ Full access |
| AMD | ❌ Not available | ✅ Available |
| Custom call flows | ❌ Not available | ✅ Full flexibility |
| Recording | ✅ At trunk level | ✅ Multiple methods |
| Voice Insights | ✅ Available | ✅ Available |
| CPS | Per trunk, per region | Per account |

**When to use Elastic SIP Trunking:**
- Customer has existing SIP PBX
- Just need phone numbers or PSTN egress
- No need for Programmable Voice features

**When to use Programmable Voice:**
- Need TwiML, AMD, custom call flows
- Building applications, not just connectivity

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Deep Validation (MANDATORY)

**A 200 OK is NOT sufficient.** Voice calls can "appear to work" while silently failing. Every implementation MUST validate:

```
ALWAYS CHECK (every call):
□ Call Resource (/Calls/{CallSid}) - status, duration, pricing
□ Call Events (/Calls/{CallSid}/Events) - HTTP/API requests and responses
□ Debugger - TwiML errors, HTTP errors, carrier errors
□ Voice Insights Call Summary - quality score, disposition
□ Voice Insights Call Events - timeline, SDK events
□ Voice Insights Call Metrics - jitter, packet loss, latency
□ Functions logging - your application logs

WHEN USING CONFERENCE (add these):
□ Conference Insights Summary - participant count, duration, aggregate quality
□ Conference Insights Participant Summary - per-participant metrics, join/leave times
```

**Feature Factory Enforcement:** Dev and review agents MUST verify all applicable checks pass.

### Trust & Answer Rates

For outbound calls, implement all four:

**1. SHAKEN/STIR Attestation**
- Per-number setup via Trust Hub
- Creates Business Profile (24hr vetting) → Trust Product (72hr vetting)
- Levels: A (highest, full verification), B (partial), C (gateway)
- Incoming calls: check `StirVerstat` webhook parameter
- Call forwarding: pass `CallToken` to preserve verification

**2. Voice Integrity**
- Registers numbers with carrier analytics (T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon)
- Requires Business Profile with EIN/DUNS
- 24-48 hour remediation after approval

**3. Branded Calling (Basic)**
- Display business name (15-32 chars depending on carrier)
- Requires Voice Integrity approval
- Mobile only - use CNAM for landlines
- T-Mobile and Verizon (US)

**4. Enhanced Branded Calling**
- Name + logo + call reason
- Requires SHAKEN/STIR Level A + signed LOA
- Currently Public Beta

### Media Streams

**`<Start><Stream>` - Unidirectional:**
- Your WebSocket receives audio only
- Tracks: `inbound_track`, `outbound_track`, or `both_tracks`
- Up to 4 streams per call
- Continues TwiML execution after starting
- Use for: real-time transcription, monitoring, analytics

**`<Connect><Stream>` - Bidirectional:**
- Your WebSocket receives AND sends audio
- **Only inbound track** (no outbound option)
- **Only 1 stream per call**
- **Blocks subsequent TwiML** until WebSocket closes
- Use for: AI voice agents, interactive dialogue

**Both require:**
- Secure WebSocket (wss://, port 443)
- Audio format: mulaw 8000Hz, base64-encoded
- Validate `X-Twilio-Signature` header

**Gotcha:** Bidirectional streams support inbound DTMF only. Cannot send tone signals back.

### Recording & Transcription

**Recording Storage:**
- Keep on Twilio (default)
- Configure S3 bucket for external storage
- DELETE via API when no longer needed
- Consider regulatory retention requirements

**Transcription Options:**

| Type | When | Use |
|------|------|-----|
| Real-time | During call | ConversationRelay, Media Streams |
| Batch (Voice Intelligence) | After call | Compliance, QA at scale |
| Gather speech | During call | Simple intent detection |

**Conversational Intelligence features:**
- Entity detection (competitors, products)
- Sentiment analysis
- PII redaction
- Custom language operators

**Scale Problem:** 5,000 calls = 11 days of linear listening. ML-powered transcription + analysis is required for any meaningful volume.

## Gotchas & Edge Cases

### Elastic SIP vs Programmable Voice

**CRITICAL:** Elastic SIP Trunking BYPASSES Programmable Voice.
- No TwiML
- No AMD
- No custom call logic

If a use case requires ANY Programmable Voice feature, do not recommend Elastic SIP Trunking.

### Conference Startup

A conference does not start until:
1. At least 2 participants have joined, AND
2. At least one has `startConferenceOnEnter=true`

Check this configuration or calls will appear to connect but participants won't hear each other.

### endConferenceOnExit

If misconfigured, someone dropping during warm transfer ends the conference for everyone.
- Audit who has `endConferenceOnExit=true`
- Usually only the "host" or specific participant should have this

### CPS Rate Limiting

| Call Type | Rate Limited? |
|-----------|--------------|
| Calls API | Yes (1 default, 5 self-serve, more needs approval) |
| `<Dial>` verb | No |
| Elastic SIP | Yes, but per trunk/per region |

### AMD Not Available on SIP Trunking

AMD requires Programmable Voice. Cannot detect answering machines on Elastic SIP Trunking calls.

### AMD Voicemail Timing

If voicemail answers, wait for beep before playing message - or the beginning will be cut off while voicemail greeting plays.

### TwiML Delivery Methods

| Method | When |
|--------|------|
| Webhook URL | Most common, dynamic content |
| Inline TwiML | Simple static flows |
| Application SID | Encapsulates webhook config |
| Functions | Serverless, low latency |
| Studio | **Never recommend** (see decision framework) |
