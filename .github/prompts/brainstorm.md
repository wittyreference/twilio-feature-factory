## Your Brainstorm Topic

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step concept/charter/pitch for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Once we are done, save the output as concept.md

Here’s the idea:
