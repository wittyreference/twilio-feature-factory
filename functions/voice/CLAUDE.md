## TwiML Voice Verbs

Common verbs: `<Say>`, `<Play>`, `<Gather>`, `<Dial>`, `<Record>`, `<Conference>`, `<Hangup>`, `<Redirect>`, `<Pause>`.

For detailed options, see [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md).

## Voice Webhook Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `CallSid` | Unique identifier for the call |
| `AccountSid` | Your Twilio Account SID |
| `From` | Caller's phone number (E.164) |
| `To` | Called phone number (E.164) |
| `CallStatus` | Current call status |
| `Direction` | `inbound` or `outbound-api` |
| `CallerName` | Caller name (if available) |
| `FromCity` | Caller's city |
| `FromState` | Caller's state |
| `FromCountry` | Caller's country |

Gather callbacks include: `Digits` (DTMF), `SpeechResult` (transcribed), `Confidence` (0-1).

## TwiML Control Model

**Critical**: In almost all cases, only ONE TwiML document controls a call at any given time.

**Exception — Background Operations**: Some verbs fork off and continue running while the call executes other TwiML:
- `<Start><Stream>` — Media streaming continues
- `<Start><Recording>` — Recording continues until explicitly stopped
- `<Start><Siprec>` — SIPREC streaming continues

**Key Implications**:
1. Updating participant TwiML exits current state (e.g., exits conference)
2. Conference teardown risk if exiting participant has `endConferenceOnExit=true`
3. "Transfer" in conference context means adding a participant, NOT replacing TwiML

## Logging and Response Rules

| Log Level | Alert Code | Effect |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| `console.log` | None | Silent — use for all operational logging |
| `console.warn` | 82004 | Generates warning alert — **never use** |
| `console.error` | 82005 | Generates error alert — **never use** |

Always pass a string to `response.setBody()`, not an object. Use `JSON.stringify()` and set `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Gotchas

### Env Vars Can Reset on Deploy

`twilio serverless:deploy` doesn't preserve runtime env vars set via Console or CLI. Verify and re-set after deployment.

### `<Start><Recording>` Syntax is `.recording()`, Not `.record()`

The correct syntax is `twiml.start().recording({...})`. Using `.record()` is a different verb (`<Record>`).

### Conference Has No Parent/Child Relationships

Each conference participant is independent. One disconnecting doesn't affect others unless `endConferenceOnExit=true`. Different from `<Dial>` where parent/child are coupled.

### `<Pause>` as First TwiML Verb Does Not Answer

A webhook returning `<Pause>` as the first verb never answers the call — it continues ringing. Always produce audio (`<Say>` or `<Play>`) first.

### `<Record>` Without `action` Creates Infinite Loop

`<Record>` without `action` POSTs back to self, re-executing and creating multiple recordings. Always set `action` to a different handler or use `<Start><Recording>` instead.

### Conference Recording via Participants API

Do NOT use `client.conferences(name).recordings.create()` with friendly names — it fails. Instead, set `conferenceRecord: 'record-from-start'` on the participant create call.

### Conference Participants API vs TwiML `<Conference>`

| Parameter | Participants API | TwiML |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Recording | Boolean: `true` / `false` | String: `record-from-start`, `record-from-answer`, etc. |

Passing TwiML values to API returns HTTP 400.

### Recording Callback URLs Must Be Absolute

`<Start><Recording>` requires absolute URLs. Relative paths trigger error 11200 — recording completes but callback never fires.

Note: `<Gather action>` and `<Dial action>` resolve relative URLs correctly. This inconsistency only affects `<Start><Recording>`.

### Dial `action` URL Should Not Be the Inbound Handler

When `<Dial action="/voice/my-handler">` is set, the handler fires again after Dial completes. One-time resource creation (e.g., Sync documents) produces "Unique name already exists" errors (54302). Use a dedicated Dial-complete handler or make creation idempotent.

### Deployment Resets Phone Number Webhooks

`twilio serverless:deploy` can reset phone number voice URLs to previous values. Always verify and re-set after deployment.

### Conference Recording Captures Hold Music

When using `Record=true` on Participants API, recording starts from conference creation. If AMD classification takes time, recording captures minutes of hold music and transcripts get dominated by `[music]` tags.

### Avoid Duplicate Recordings

Don't combine `--record` CLI flag (or `Record=true` API param) with `<Start><Recording>` TwiML — creates two recordings (1-channel vs 2-channel). Pick one method.

### Participants API to Twilio Numbers Invokes the Voice URL

The Participants API does NOT auto-generate conference TwiML. When adding a Twilio number as participant, that number's voice URL fires and must return conference-joining TwiML. Conference name is NOT in webhook params — use `make_call` with `?ConferenceName=X` query param instead.

### `make_call(To=TwilioNumber)` Creates Two Independent TwiML Legs

When `make_call` targets a Twilio number, two separate call legs execute independently:
- **Parent leg** (outbound-api): Runs the `Url` parameter's TwiML
- **Child leg** (inbound): Runs the number's configured voice webhook TwiML

Both execute simultaneously and are bridged. A single `make_call` produces TWO TwiML documents on TWO call SIDs. For conference patterns, call each participant separately with their own `Url` TwiML.

### Testing Outbound Calls to Twilio Numbers

When calling TO a Twilio number for testing, that number's voice webhook fires for the child leg. If the destination number has no voice URL configured (or it's empty), the call fails silently. Deploy a "stay-on-line" function and configure it as the voice URL on test destination numbers.

### Pre-E2E: Verify ALL Phone Numbers Have Voice URLs

Before E2E tests, verify every phone number in the call flow has a voice URL — not just inbound/tracking numbers, but Dial destinations, agent numbers, and business lines. A number with `voiceUrl: null` causes `<Dial>` to fail immediately with no useful error.

## File Naming Conventions

- `*.js` — Public endpoints (no signature validation)
- `*.protected.js` — Protected endpoints (require valid Twilio signature)
- `*.private.js` — Private functions (not accessible via HTTP)
